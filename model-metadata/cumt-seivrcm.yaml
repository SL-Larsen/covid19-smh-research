methods: "Run the SEIVR model on the contact matrices among different races/ethnicities."
methods_long: "We ran a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Vaccinated-Recovered (SEIRV) model, coupled with contact matrices among different races/ethnicities. In the calibration phase, we used serology data and the number of deaths to construct infection-to-fatality rates (IFR) for different races/ethnicities. We employed a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to fit the beta values and the seeds for different races/ethnicities monthly. In the projection phase, we used the final beta and IFR in the calibration, combined with a seasonal cycle and a linear function of NPIs, to project the number of deaths."
