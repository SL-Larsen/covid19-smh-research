methods: "This model is an adapted version of the ODE system published in Larsen et al. (Science Advances, 2023), replacing socioeconomic stratification with race/ethnicity structure and an explicitly NPI-compliant class."
methods_long: "This compartmental SEIR model tracks individuals through two levels of immunity (fully naive, previously infected/vaccinated). Daily contacts, case reporting rate, npi compliance, vaccination, and infection fatality rate are all stratified by race/ethnicity. The model is calibrated to cases and deaths using maximum likelihood estimation. During the projection period, uncertainty is incorporated through Latin hypercube sampling on profiled parameters (NPI compliance/duration, reporting rate and IFR) and on a range of possible changes in NPI compliance in the projection period relative to the calibration period."
